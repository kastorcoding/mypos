# myposâ„¢ a coffee sale system

## Introduction
One of my first jobs was at a coffee store so I spent plenty of time taking orders and using a POS system. In the time between orders I felt like there was so much lacking that could make my job go faster or at least be performed more easily, and so I decided to code my own! This POS aims to fix some of the issues I saw while also giving me an idea of what really went into making the technology that I used every day.

## History
In 2022 I made a POS system for CMSC202 at my local community college. This was one of the first real projects I came up with an idea for and coded all on my own. However, since it was a project for a class I had to incorporate some things that didn't make too much sense coding wise and that lowered the quality of the project a lot. It was also one of my first projects so while the code was well commented and fairly well structured, it lacks a lot of the insight I have now 3 years later. As I'm now looking for jobs I figured it best to fix and publish some of my older projects I made to build up my resume. This new project takes inspiration from the old code and concept but is made to work in a manner that makes sense, thus I'm pretty much writing it from scratch.
